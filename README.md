This project will contain a variety of tools to represent and manipulate images in different formats. It is primarily intended as a learning project so I can work more with Rust and familiarize myself with basic Rust development.

Because this is a learning project, much of the early code is likely to be inefficient and non-idiomatic. It will be subject to significant refactoring and potentially breaking changes over time, so I don't recommend using it in other projects for now.

PNG code is based on the spec at https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-PNG-20031110 .
